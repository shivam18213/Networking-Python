# Networking-Python

This repository consists of implementation of socket module in Python. </br>
I practiced these exercise in my networking course at VIT, Chennai. </br>
For each exercise there is a question, code and explination in pdf that I submitted to the respected faculty. </br>

This can be very useful for undergraduate students preparing for interviews or need some basic understanding of networking.
